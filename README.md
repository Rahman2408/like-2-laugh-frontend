## Local Deployment Instructions

   All "run" instructions refer to in your terminal while actively in the root directory of this app, ```like-to-laugh-frontend```.
#

   1. Complete deployment instructions for the backend and be sure the rails server is running on port 3000.
#
   2.  Set an ENV variable called API by creating a file named `.env` in the root directory containing the following:

        `REACT_APP_API=http://localhost:3000`
#
   3. Next, install packages by running:
      
          npm install
#
   4. To avoid conflict with the backend server, force the port for the `npm start` command to listen on port 3001 by changing line 19 in [package.json](/package.json) 
      
       replace (existing): 
       
        `"start": "react-scripts start",` 
      
       with (new):
       
        `"start": "PORT=3001 react-scripts start",`
#
   5. Now in your terminal you can run:
          
          npm start

      - This should open the app in your browser to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

#
  6. If the last step didn't open the app in your browser automatically click [here](http://localhost:3001) to view the app it in your browser.

  7. ENJOY!üòÅ
